## Query Examples

### Basic Queries

<CodeGroup>

```python Work Information
# Find career and work-related information
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json={
    "query": "What does the user do for work?",
    "categories": ["career"],
    "limit": 10
})
```

```python Personal Interests
# Find hobbies and interests
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json={
    "query": "What are the user's hobbies and interests?",
    "categories": ["interests"],
    "limit": 8
})
```

```python Current Projects
# Find current activities and projects
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json={
    "query": "What is the user currently working on?",
    "categories": ["career", "learning"],
    "rerank": True,
    "limit": 5
})
```

```python Comprehensive Overview
# Get broad understanding of the user
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json={
    "query": "Tell me about this user",
    "rerank": True,
    "limit": 15
})
```

</CodeGroup>

### Advanced Queries

<CodeGroup>

```python Contextual Search
# Search with conversation context
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json={
    "query": "What would help the user with their career goals?",
    "categories": ["career", "learning"],
    "rerank": True,
    "limit": 10
})
```

```python Preference Queries
# Find preferences and dislikes
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json={
    "query": "What does the user like and dislike?",
    "categories": ["interests", "productivity"],
    "limit": 12
})
```

```python Relationship Context
# Find social and relationship information
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json={
    "query": "Who is important to the user?",
    "categories": ["relationships"],
    "limit": 8
})
```

</CodeGroup>

## Understanding Search Results

### Vector Distance

The `vector_distance` indicates semantic similarity:
- **0.0-0.3**: Highly relevant and closely related
- **0.3-0.6**: Moderately relevant  
- **0.6-1.0**: Less relevant, may be tangentially related

### Rerank Score

When `rerank: true` is enabled, the `rerank_score` provides enhanced relevance:
- **0.8-1.0**: Excellent match for the query
- **0.6-0.8**: Good match with clear relevance
- **0.4-0.6**: Fair match, some relevance
- **0.0-0.4**: Weak match, limited relevance

### Result Ordering

Results are ordered by relevance:
1. **With reranking**: Ordered by `rerank_score` (descending)
2. **Without reranking**: Ordered by `vector_distance` (ascending)

## Best Practices

### Query Optimization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Natural Language">
    Write queries as natural questions rather than keywords
    
    ```python
    # ✅ Good
    "What technical skills does the user have?"
    
    # ❌ Less effective  
    "skills technical programming"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be Specific">
    Specific queries often yield better results than generic ones
    
    ```python
    # ✅ Better
    "What programming languages is the user learning?"
    
    # ❌ Too generic
    "user learning"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Categories">
    Filter by categories for more targeted results
    
    ```python
    # For work-related queries
    {"query": "user responsibilities", "categories": ["career"]}
    
    # For personal interests
    {"query": "user hobbies", "categories": ["interests"]}
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable Reranking">
    Use reranking for complex or important queries
    
    ```python
    # For nuanced queries
    {
        "query": "How does the user balance work and personal life?",
        "rerank": True,
        "categories": ["career", "health", "relationships"]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Performance Tips

- **Appropriate Limits**: Use reasonable limits (5-15 for most use cases)
- **Category Filtering**: Reduce search space with relevant categories
- **Caching**: Cache frequent queries to improve response times
- **Batch Processing**: Group related searches when possible

## Common Use Cases

### Personalized Responses

```python
def get_context_for_response(user_message):
    context_search = {
        "query": f"What's relevant to helping with: {user_message}",
        "limit": 8,
        "rerank": True
    }
    
    response = requests.post(search_url, headers=headers, json=context_search)
    memories = response.json()['memories']
    
    return [m['memory'] for m in memories]
```

### User Analysis

```python
def analyze_user_interests():
    searches = [
        {"query": "What is the user passionate about?", "categories": ["interests"]},
        {"query": "What is the user learning?", "categories": ["learning"]},
        {"query": "What are the user's goals?", "categories": ["career", "health"]}
    ]
    
    analysis = {}
    for search in searches:
        response = requests.post(search_url, headers=headers, json=search)
        analysis[search['query']] = response.json()['memories']
    
    return analysis
```

### Content Recommendations

```python
def get_content_recommendations():
    interests_search = {
        "query": "What topics interest the user?",
        "categories": ["interests", "learning"],
        "limit": 10
    }
    
    response = requests.post(search_url, headers=headers, json=interests_search)
    memories = response.json()['memories']
    
    # Extract topics for content recommendation
    topics = extract_topics_from_memories(memories)
    return generate_content_suggestions(topics)
```

## Rate Limiting

Search endpoints have enhanced rate limiting:
- **50 requests per minute** per authenticated user
- Complex queries with reranking may take slightly longer
- Consider implementing client-side caching for frequent queries

## Error Codes

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Invalid request format or parameters |
| `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR` | Invalid or missing JWT token |
| `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Too many search requests |
| `NO_MEMORIES_FOUND` | No memories exist for the user |
