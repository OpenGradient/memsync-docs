api: "DELETE /memories/{memory_id}"
description: "Permanently delete a memory entry and its associated embeddings"
---

Permanently removes a memory entry from the user's memory store. This action cannot be undone.

<Warning>
This operation is irreversible. Once a memory is deleted, it cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

<RequestExample>

```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE 'https://api.memsync.ai/memories/mem_123abc' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.memsync.ai/memories/mem_123abc"
headers = {
    "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers)
result = response.json()
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.memsync.ai/memories/mem_123abc', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  },
});

const result = await response.json();
```

  ```
</ResponseField>

## Batch Deletion

For deleting multiple memories at once, use the batch endpoint:

```bash
POST /memories/batch-delete
{
  "memory_ids": ["mem_123abc", "mem_456def", "mem_789ghi"],
  "cascade": true,
  "backup": true
}
```

## Recovery Options

While deleted memories cannot be restored through the API, backups are created for compliance purposes:

- **Backups**: Available for 30 days for compliance/audit purposes
- **Contact Support**: For accidental deletions, contact support with the backup_id
- **Data Export**: Consider using the data export feature before bulk deletions

## Impact on User Profile

Deleting memories may affect:
- **Profile Bio**: Auto-generated bio may be updated
- **Category Profiles**: Statistics and insights for the memory's category
- **Derived Insights**: Any insights based on the deleted memory
- **Search Results**: Memory will no longer appear in search results

Use the `cascade=true` parameter to automatically clean up related data, or `cascade=false` to preserve derived insights for analysis.
