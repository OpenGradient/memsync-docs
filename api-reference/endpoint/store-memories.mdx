## How Memory Extraction Works

When you store a conversation, MemSync performs several steps:

1. **Context Analysis**: Analyzes the full conversation to understand context and meaning
2. **Fact Extraction**: Identifies meaningful facts and information about the user
3. **Memory Classification**: Categorizes memories as semantic (lasting facts) or episodic (time-bound events)
4. **Category Assignment**: Assigns memories to relevant categories (career, interests, etc.)
5. **Storage**: Stores memories with vector embeddings for semantic search

## Best Practices

### Message Quality
- Include sufficient context in conversations for better memory extraction
- Use natural language rather than fragmented responses
- Include follow-up questions and clarifications when relevant

### Conversation Structure
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I'm a software engineer who loves hiking and photography"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant", 
      "content": "That's a great combination! Do you have any favorite hiking spots where you like to take photos?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yes! I love going to Yosemite National Park. I've been there 5 times in the past 2 years."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Metadata Usage
Include relevant metadata to enhance memory context:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2024-03-20T10:00:00Z",
    "platform": "mobile-app",
    "session_id": "session-xyz789",
    "conversation_type": "onboarding",
    "user_initiated": true
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

This endpoint has standard rate limiting:
- **100 requests per minute** per authenticated user
- Bulk processing may take longer for large conversations
- Consider implementing retry logic for high-volume applications

## Error Codes

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Invalid request format or missing required fields |
| `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR` | Invalid or missing API key |
| `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Too many requests in the time window |
| `PROCESSING_ERROR` | Error occurred during memory extraction |
