## Generation Requirements

Bio generation requires:
- **Minimum memories**: At least 5 stored memories
- **Category diversity**: Memories from at least 2 different categories
- **Content quality**: Memories with sufficient text content (>10 words each)

## Refresh Behavior

- **Automatic refresh**: Bios are refreshed when significant new memories are added
- **Manual refresh**: Use `refresh=true` to force regeneration
- **Cooldown period**: Refreshes are limited to once every 10 minutes
- **Expiration**: Bios are considered stale after 7 days and will auto-refresh on next request

## Privacy Considerations

- Bio generation respects memory privacy settings
- Private category memories are excluded unless specifically enabled
- Bio visibility can be controlled through profile privacy settings
- Generated bios never include sensitive metadata like exact locations or private details
