# Welcome to MemSync

MemSync is a powerful platform for creating personalized AI experiences by managing long-term context and user memories. Transform your AI applications from stateless interactions into intelligent, context-aware experiences that remember and learn from every conversation.

## Why MemSync?

Traditional AI applications forget everything after each conversation. MemSync changes this by:

- **Extracting meaningful facts** from conversations automatically
- **Storing long-term memories** in organized, searchable formats
- **Providing semantic search** to find relevant context instantly
- **Building user profiles** that evolve over time
- **Integrating external data** from social media, documents, and chat history
