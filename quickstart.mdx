## Welcome to MemSync

This quickstart guide will help you integrate MemSync into your application and start building personalized AI experiences. You'll learn how to store memories, search for relevant context, and retrieve user profiles.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- A MemSync account and API key
- Basic knowledge of REST APIs
- Your preferred programming language setup (Python, JavaScript, curl, etc.)

## Authentication

MemSync uses API key-based authentication for all API requests. You'll need to include your API key in the X-API-Key header:

```bash
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Note>
  **Coming Soon**: App-specific API keys for enhanced security and easier integration.
</Note>

## Step 1: Store Your First Memory

Let's start by storing a conversation that MemSync will process to extract meaningful memories:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.memsync.ai/v1/memories"
headers = {
    "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

data = {
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": "I'm a software engineer at Google working on machine learning projects. I love hiking and photography in my free time."
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant", 
            "content": "That's great! It sounds like you have a nice balance between your technical work and creative hobbies."
        }
    ],
    "agent_id": "my-chatbot",
    "thread_id": "conversation-123",
    "source": "chat"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.memsync.ai/v1/memories', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "I'\''m a software engineer at Google working on machine learning projects. I love hiking and photography in my free time."
      },
      {
        role: "assistant",
        content: "That'\''s great! It sounds like you have a nice balance between your technical work and creative hobbies."
      }
    ],
    agent_id: "my-chatbot",
    thread_id: "conversation-123",
    source: "chat"
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result);
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.memsync.ai/v1/memories" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I'\''m a software engineer at Google working on machine learning projects. I love hiking and photography in my free time."
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "That'\''s great! It sounds like you have a nice balance between your technical work and creative hobbies."
      }
    ],
    "agent_id": "my-chatbot",
    "thread_id": "conversation-123",
    "source": "chat"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 2: Search for Relevant Memories

Now let's search for memories related to the user's interests:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.memsync.ai/v1/memories/search"
headers = {
    "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

data = {
    "query": "What does the user do for work?",
    "limit": 5,
    "rerank": True
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
result = response.json()

print("User Bio:", result['user_bio'])
print("Relevant Memories:")
for memory in result['memories']:
    print(f"- {memory['memory']}")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.memsync.ai/v1/memories/search', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "What does the user do for work?",
    limit: 5,
    rerank: true
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log("User Bio:", result.user_bio);
console.log("Relevant Memories:");
result.memories.forEach(memory => {
  console.log(`- ${memory.memory}`);
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.memsync.ai/v1/memories/search" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What does the user do for work?",
    "limit": 5,
    "rerank": true
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 3: Get User Profile

Retrieve the user's complete profile with auto-generated bio and insights:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.memsync.ai/v1/users/profile"
headers = {
    "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
profile = response.json()

print("User Bio:", profile['user_bio'])
print("Profiles:", profile['profiles'])
print("Insights:", profile['insights'])
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.memsync.ai/v1/users/profile', {
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
});

const profile = await response.json();
console.log("User Bio:", profile.user_bio);
console.log("Profiles:", profile.profiles);
console.log("Insights:", profile.insights);
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.memsync.ai/v1/users/profile" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Understanding the Response

When you search for memories, MemSync returns:

```json
{
  "user_bio": "Software engineer at Google specializing in machine learning with interests in hiking and photography",
  "memories": [
    {
      "id": "mem_123",
      "memory": "Works as a software engineer at Google focusing on machine learning projects",
      "categories": ["career"],
      "type": "semantic",
      "vector_distance": 0.15,
      "rerank_score": 0.92,
      "source": "chat",
      "created_at": "2024-03-20T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Fields:
- **user_bio**: Auto-generated summary of the user
- **memory**: The extracted fact or memory
- **categories**: Organized tags (career, interests, etc.)
- **type**: semantic (lasting facts) or episodic (time-bound events)
- **vector_distance**: Similarity score for search relevance
- **rerank_score**: Enhanced relevance score when reranking is enabled

## Example: Building a Personalized Chatbot

Here's a complete example of how to build a chatbot that remembers user context:

```python
import requests

class PersonalizedChatbot:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_url = "https://api.memsync.ai/v1"
        self.headers = {
            "X-API-Key": api_key,
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
    
    def chat(self, user_message, user_id, thread_id="default"):
        # 1. Search for relevant memories
        memories = self.search_memories(user_message)
        
        # 2. Create context from memories
        context = self.build_context(memories)
        
        # 3. Generate response (using your LLM)
        response = self.generate_response(context, user_message)
        
        # 4. Store the conversation
        self.store_conversation(user_message, response, thread_id)
        
        return response
    
    def search_memories(self, query):
        response = requests.post(
            f"{self.base_url}/memories/search",
            headers=self.headers,
            json={"query": query, "limit": 5, "rerank": True}
        )
        return response.json()
    
    def store_conversation(self, user_msg, bot_response, thread_id):
        requests.post(
            f"{self.base_url}/memories",
            headers=self.headers,
            json={
                "messages": [
                    {"role": "user", "content": user_msg},
                    {"role": "assistant", "content": bot_response}
                ],
                "agent_id": "my-chatbot",
                "thread_id": thread_id,
                "source": "chat"
            }
        )

# Usage
chatbot = PersonalizedChatbot("YOUR_API_KEY")
response = chatbot.chat("What should I work on today?", "user123")
```
<Tip>
This example shows the basic pattern: search for context, generate response, store conversation. MemSync handles the complex memory extraction and organization automatically.

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized Error">
    Make sure your API key is valid and included in the X-API-Key header as `X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No memories returned">
    It may take a few seconds for memories to be processed and indexed. Try searching again, or check that your conversation contained meaningful information.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rate limiting">
    MemSync has rate limits to ensure service quality. If you hit limits, implement exponential backoff in your retry logic.
