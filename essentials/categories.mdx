    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Category-Based Search

Use categories to find specific types of information about users:

### Single Category Search

```python
# Find career-related memories
career_memories = memsync.search_memories(
    query="What does the user do professionally?",
    categories=["career"],
    limit=10
)

# Find current interests
interest_memories = memsync.search_memories(
    query="What are the user's hobbies?",
    categories=["interests"],
    limit=8
)
```

### Multiple Category Search

```python
# Find learning and career overlap
professional_development = memsync.search_memories(
    query="What skills is the user developing?",
    categories=["career", "learning"],
    limit=15
)

# Find health and productivity intersection
wellness_habits = memsync.search_memories(
    query="How does the user maintain work-life balance?",
    categories=["health", "productivity"],
    limit=10
)
```

### All Categories Search

```python
# Comprehensive user overview
all_memories = memsync.search_memories(
    query="Tell me about this user",
    limit=20,
    rerank=True
)
```

## Category Distribution Insights

Understanding how memories are distributed across categories can provide insights:

### Typical Distribution
- **Career**: 25-30% of memories
- **Interests**: 20-25% of memories  
- **Learning**: 15-20% of memories
- **Relationships**: 10-15% of memories
- **Health**: 8-12% of memories
- **Productivity**: 6-10% of memories
- **Identity**: 5-8% of memories
- **Travel**: 3-7% of memories
- **Finance**: 2-5% of memories
- **Private**: 1-3% of memories

<Note>
Distribution varies significantly based on user conversation patterns, application type, and personal disclosure preferences.
</Note>

## Best Practices

### For Memory Extraction

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rich Context">
    Provide detailed conversation context to help MemSync accurately categorize memories.
    
    ```python
    # Good: Provides context for categorization
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "I've been learning Python at work to automate our data pipeline tasks"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's great! Automation can save a lot of time in data workflows"}
    ]
    # Result: Likely categorized as ["career", "learning"]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Specific Information">
    Include specific details that help with accurate categorization.
    
    ```python
    # Better than: "I like to exercise"
    # Use: "I go rock climbing twice a week at the local gym for fitness and stress relief"
    # Result: Categories ["interests", "health"]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multiple Contexts">
    Don't avoid mentioning when activities span multiple life areas.
    
    ```python
    # Good: Shows intersection of categories
    "I'm taking evening MBA classes while working full-time to prepare for a career transition"
    # Result: Categories ["learning", "career"]
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### For Search Optimization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Category-Specific Queries">
    Tailor your search queries to specific categories for better results.
    
    ```python
    # Instead of generic queries, be category-specific
    career_query = "What is the user's professional background and current role?"
    interest_query = "What activities does the user enjoy in their free time?"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cross-Category Insights">
    Look for patterns across categories to understand user holistically.
    
    ```python
    # Find connections between work and personal life
    work_life_balance = memsync.search_memories(
        query="How does the user balance professional and personal priorities?",
        categories=["career", "health", "relationships"],
        limit=15
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Progressive Refinement">
    Start broad, then narrow down based on initial results.
    
    ```python
    # Step 1: Broad search
    general_memories = memsync.search_memories(query="user overview", limit=20)
    
    # Step 2: Focus on most relevant categories found
    specific_memories = memsync.search_memories(
        query="user career goals", 
        categories=["career", "learning"], 
        limit=10
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Category Evolution

Categories can provide insights into how users change over time:

### Tracking Changes
- **New categories appearing**: User exploring new areas of life
- **Category frequency changes**: Shifting priorities or life phases
- **Cross-category connections**: Growing integration of different life aspects

### Example Evolution
```python
# Early conversations: Heavy focus on career
early_categories = ["career", "learning", "productivity"]

# Later conversations: More balanced life interests
later_categories = ["career", "interests", "relationships", "health", "travel"]
```
