# User Profiles

MemSync automatically generates comprehensive user profiles from accumulated memories, providing rich context about users without manual curation. These profiles include biographical summaries, categorized insights, and derived personality traits.

## What are User Profiles?

User profiles in MemSync are auto-generated summaries that synthesize memories into meaningful insights about users. They're designed to provide AI applications with deep user understanding while maintaining privacy and accuracy.

## User Bio

The user bio is a high-level summary designed to give AI applications quick context about who the user is.

### Bio Characteristics

- **Concise**: Typically 2-4 sentences
- **Information-dense**: Combines related facts efficiently
- **Readable**: Written in natural language, not bullet points
- **Dynamic**: Updates automatically as new memories are added
- **Prioritized**: Focuses on most important and stable information

### Example Bio

```json
{
  "user_bio": "Software engineer at Google specializing in machine learning infrastructure with 8 years of experience. Passionate about hiking, photography, and sustainable living. Currently learning Spanish and training for a marathon while working on a side project in AI ethics."
}

## Using Profiles in Applications

### Basic Profile Retrieval

```python
import requests

# Get complete user profile
response = requests.get("https://api.memsync.ai/v1/users/profile",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"}
)

profile = response.json()
print(f"Bio: {profile['user_bio']}")
print(f"Career: {profile['profiles']['career']}")
print(f"Interests: {profile['profiles']['interests']}")
```

### Profile-Based Personalization

```python
def personalize_content(user_profile):
    bio = user_profile['user_bio']
    insights = user_profile['insights']['identity']['insights']
    
    # Extract key information
    interests = insights['interests']
    communication_tone = insights['communication_tone']
    likes = insights['likes']
    
    # Customize content based on profile
    if 'analytical' in communication_tone:
        response_style = "detailed and data-driven"
    else:
        response_style = "concise and practical"
    
    return {
        'content_topics': interests,
        'response_style': response_style,
        'engagement_triggers': likes
    }
```

### Dynamic Profile Updates

```python
def check_profile_freshness(user_id):
    # Get current profile
    profile = get_user_profile(user_id)
    
    # Get recent memories
    recent_memories = get_recent_memories(user_id, days=7)
    
    # Check if profile should be updated
    if should_update_profile(profile, recent_memories):
        # Trigger profile regeneration
        trigger_profile_update(user_id)
```

## Profile Quality and Accuracy

### Quality Indicators

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Memory Coverage">
    Profiles are more accurate with diverse memory coverage across categories
    
    ```python
    def assess_profile_coverage(memories):
        categories = set(m.category for m in memories)
        coverage_score = len(categories) / 10  # 10 total categories
        return coverage_score
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Memory Recency">
    Recent memories ensure profiles reflect current user state
    
    ```python
    def assess_profile_freshness(memories):
        recent_memories = [m for m in memories if days_since(m.created_at) < 30]
        freshness_score = len(recent_memories) / len(memories)
        return freshness_score
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consistency">
    Consistent information across memories improves profile reliability
    
    ```python
    def assess_profile_consistency(memories):
        # Check for conflicting information
        conflicts = detect_memory_conflicts(memories)
        consistency_score = 1 - (len(conflicts) / len(memories))
        return consistency_score
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Improving Profile Quality

<Steps>
  <Step title="Encourage Diverse Conversations">
    Ask users about different aspects of their lives to build comprehensive profiles
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Regular Updates">
    Ensure conversations happen regularly to keep profiles current
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Depth Over Breadth">
    Sometimes, encourage deeper discussions about specific topics
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Validate Information">
    Occasionally confirm important details to ensure accuracy
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Privacy and Control

### Profile Visibility

Users have control over their profile information:

- **Bio Editing**: Users can manually edit their auto-generated bio
- **Category Control**: Users can choose which categories to include in profiles
- **Privacy Settings**: Sensitive information can be marked as private
- **Data Export**: Users can export their complete profile data

### Manual Bio Override

```python
# Allow users to override auto-generated bio
def update_user_bio(user_id, custom_bio):
    response = requests.put("https://api.memsync.ai/v1/users/bio",
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"},
        json={"user_bio": custom_bio}
    )
    return response.json()
```

## Profile Evolution

### Tracking Changes Over Time

```python
def track_profile_evolution(user_id):
    # Get historical profile snapshots
    profiles = get_profile_history(user_id)
    
    # Analyze changes
    changes = []
    for i in range(1, len(profiles)):
        prev_profile = profiles[i-1]
        curr_profile = profiles[i]
        
        # Detect significant changes
        if bio_changed_significantly(prev_profile, curr_profile):
            changes.append({
                'date': curr_profile['updated_at'],
                'type': 'bio_update',
                'description': 'Major life change detected'
            })
    
    return changes
```

### Adaptation Patterns

Common profile evolution patterns:

- **Career Transitions**: Changes in professional profiles during job changes
- **Life Events**: Updates following major life events (marriage, moving, etc.)
- **Skill Development**: Learning profiles evolving as users acquire new skills
- **Interest Shifts**: Interest profiles adapting to new hobbies and passions

## Best Practices

### For Developers

        profile = get_user_profile(user_id)
        
        # Use profile to inform response
        context = f"User background: {profile['user_bio']}"
        interests = profile['insights']['identity']['insights']['interests']
        
        # Generate personalized response
        return create_contextual_response(user_message, context, interests)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Profile Caching">

    def get_cached_profile(user_id, cache_key):
        return get_user_profile(user_id)
    
    def get_profile_with_cache(user_id):
        # Create cache key that expires daily
        cache_key = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        return get_cached_profile(user_id, cache_key)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Graceful Degradation">
    Handle cases where profiles are incomplete or unavailable
    
    ```python
    def get_user_context(user_id):
        try:
            profile = get_user_profile(user_id)
            return profile['user_bio']
        except Exception:
            # Fallback to basic memory search
            memories = search_memories("user overview", user_id, limit=5)
            return summarize_memories(memories)
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### For Applications

        if request_type == "learning":
            return recommend_courses(interests)
        elif request_type == "content":
            return recommend_articles(interests)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Personalization">
    Tailor user experience based on profile insights

    def customize_interface(user_id):
        profile = get_user_profile(user_id)
        traits = profile['insights']['identity']['derived_traits']
        
        if 'analytical' in traits:
            return show_detailed_interface()
        else:
